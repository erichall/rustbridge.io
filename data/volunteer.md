## Volunteer

RustBridge is an entirely volunteer run project, and we are always looking
for more people to help spread inclusive Rust education around the world.

There are several ways to get involved:

#### Organize

RustBridge requires a fair amount of organization to run! People who are 
familiar with event management can help teachers find and secure venues,
manage attendance, and help market and promote events to local meeetups
and communities around the world.

#### Teach

RustBridge is a very hands-on workshop, with lots of guidance, and depends
on the efforts of teachers to help set the tone and drive the success of
the event.

Advanced beginners make the best teachers, so if you are concerned that you
might not be a good enough Rust developer to teach this workshop- think again!
You are probably at the perfect experience level to help introduce new 
people to the language.

#### Mentor

A key component to the success of NodeTogether is partnering with the local
community to bring in empathetic and energetic mentors. No teaching experience
is required, but it certainly is a plus!

This is your chance to give back to the community and get in touch with exciting
new programming talents. Don’t be shy! Everyone’s experience is valuable, and so
is yours.

#### Sponsor

We are always looking for sponsors to help fund travel for mentors, provide
space for events, or catering.

Sponsors will get prominent display on event pages as well as the option to
distribute swag at events.
