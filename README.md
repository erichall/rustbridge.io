# Rustbridge
Free and guided workshops in Rust â€“ a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

Our events are aimed at people who are underrepresented in technology and offer the opportunity to learn within a friendly, safe and sometimes fun environment. We do this by providing rewarding learning experiences, building helpful tools as well as materials and gathering a group of awesome humans. RustBridge is a project by the Rust Language Community Team.

# Requirments 
* Rust development enviroment setup: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)
